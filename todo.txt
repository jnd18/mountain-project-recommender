Todo:
Figure out how to scrape mountain project ratings data
Look into differences between svd and nmf style factorizations
Implement a simple matrix factorization algorithm using sgd
    pytorch's auto grad would remove the need for certain derivations, but I might use numpy instead of learning pytorch
Try out simple algorithm on synthetic or benchmark data
Run algo on climbing data
Try to interpret meanings of latent factors, for fun
Create a useful interface:
    deploy on web somehow?
    use a gnoosic-style interface? How to give recommendations to people not in data?
    add options for filtering based on grade, rating, trad vs sport, etc?
Write up some blog posts explaining everything
